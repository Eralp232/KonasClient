# Information
Konas Client has been discontinued for quite some time now, so this repository will essentially serve as an official repository for Konas Client. Here, you'll find the best available source code for Konas, along with crack versions and leaked builds that don't include any HWID restrictions. Since Konas is no longer receiving updates, unfortunately, no support or maintenance is provided for it.

There are a few bugs in version 0.8, and crashes might occur. It seems that the most stable versions are either 0.10.5 or 1.0.1. However, in terms of appearance and aesthetics, I still prefer version 0.8.
